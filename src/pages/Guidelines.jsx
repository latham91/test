          <h3>The Guidelines: The Cat`s Meow for a Purr-fect Experience!</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Purr-sistence Pays Off:</strong> Keep your claws sharp, your fur groomed, and your whiskers quivering
              with delight. OnlyCats rewards those who pounce on every opportunity for fun and frolic!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mind Your Paws and Qs:</strong> Treat every furr-tastic member of our community with the kindness and
              respect they deserve. Remember, even the mightiest lions appreciate a gentle scratch under the chin every meow
              and then.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Purr-fect Profiles, Purr-fect Matches:</strong> Whether you`re a sleek Siamese or a fluffy Persian, let
              your purr-sonality shine through in your profile. And remember, compatibility goes beyond fur length and eye
              color. It`s all about finding that special someone who makes your tail twitch!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Litter Box is for Paws, Not Claws:</strong> While we appreciate a good scratch post, save your
              claws for unraveling yarn balls, not stirring up trouble. Inappropriate behavior, including but not limited to
              hissing, spitting, or stealing someone else`s tuna, is strictly furrbidden.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fur-ever Learning:</strong> Embrace your inner curious cat and explore the endless treasures that
              OnlyCats has to offer. From insightful articles on the latest catnip trends to heartwarming tales of rescue
              kitties finding their purr-ever homes, there`s always something new to discover!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pawsome Photos, Meow-velous Moments:</strong> Share your most whisker-twitching, tail-wagging moments
              with the world! Whether you`re capturing the perfect mid-air leap or showcasing your latest cardboard box
              conquest, remember to strike a pose and say `cheese``... or should we say, `treats`!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spread Pawsitivity, Not Litter:</strong> Be the catnip in someone`s day! Whether you`re sharing a
              heartfelt meow-sage or lending a sympathetic ear to a fellow feline furball in need, remember that a little
              kindness goes a long way in making the world a better place... one purr at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>If You`ve Got It, Haunt It:</strong> Let your inner wildcat roam free and show off your fiercest feline
              finesse! Whether you`re strutting your stuff in a dapper bow tie or flaunting your floof in a luxurious fur
              coat, remember that confidence is key... and a well-timed hair flip never hurt anyone!
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Remember, at OnlyCats, the possibilities are as endless as a ball of yarn on a lazy Sunday afternoon. So grab
            your favorite feather toy, curl up in your coziest sunbeam, and let the purring commence!

          <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Cat-Exclusive Content:</strong> OnlyCats is dedicated to celebrating our whiskered companions. Content
              shared on this platform must be cat-related, whether it`s heartwarming cat videos, purrfect cat memes, or
              adorable cat photoshoots. Any non-feline content will be swiftly paw-ltered out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Purrsonal Conduct:</strong> We expect all members of our meow-nificent community to treat each other
              with the utmost respect and kindness. Any hiss-terical behavior, including trolling, bullying, or litter-ally
              any form of negativity, will not be tolerated. Let`s keep the vibes fur-bulously positive!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feline Privacy:</strong> A cat`s privacy is our top priority. Please refrain from sharing any purrsonal
              information about your feline companions that could compromise their safety or security. This includes but is
              not limited to their favorite nap spots, preferred belly tickle techniques, and the location of their secret
              treat stash.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paws Off Piracy:</strong> All content shared on OnlyCats must be original or appropriately attributed.
              Copycat behavior, such as unauthorized reproduction of content or claiming someone else`s purrwork as your own,
              is strictly prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Furry Friendships:</strong> While OnlyCats celebrates the bond between humans and cats, it`s important
              to remember that not all cats are looking for fur-ternal relationships. Respect boundaries and consent, whether
              you`re sending a virtual nose boop or engaging in a casual chat. Remember, enthusiastic purring does not always
              equal consent.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            By accessing or using OnlyCats, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions. Failure to comply may result in
            a temporary timeout or, in severe cases, being banished to the litter box of shame.
